# Product List Filter Application

## Overview
This project is an assignment for Gaza Sky Geeks, consisting of two phases aimed at creating a functional and visually appealing web page that displays a filterable list of products. The initial phase involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation, while the second phase converts the solution into a React application.

## Phase 1: HTML, CSS & JavaScript Implementation
In this phase, I created a web page that allows users to filter a list of products by category. The implementation includes a structured HTML layout, styled with CSS for a visually appealing design and JavaScript for dynamic functionality.

### Branch
- **Phase 1 Branch:** All developments for this phase are contained in the `phase-1` branch.

## Phase 2: React Conversion
In the second phase, I converted the Phase 1 implementation into a React application, applying concepts learned from the Mosh Hamedani React tutorial. The React version includes component-based architecture and state management.

### Branch
- **Phase 2 Branch:** All developments for this phase are contained in the `phase-2` branch.

## Node Version
This project was developed using Node version **v20.10.0**.

## Conclusion
This challenge was an opportunity to evaluate my front-end development skills and ability to learn and apply new technologies, specifically React.js, within a given timeframe.
